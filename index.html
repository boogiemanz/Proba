	<h2>MORE REALISTICALLY, THE QUESTION IS, "WHY NOT JOIN?"</h2>

	<p>Boogie Travel offers independent contractors something very desirable in today's extremely challenging market: <br/>The ability to compete, and even thrive.<br/>
	How, you ask? Let us count the ways:</p>

	<h3>MULTIPLE GDS SYSTEMS</h3>

	<p>Boogie Travel provides you access to multiple GDS travel systems, cutting edge technology, and higher commission structures. You'll also enjoy premier resources and competitive advantages, like access to the Virtuoso network and strong vendor relationships with key travel suppliers that will enable you to grow your business without relinquishing your independence. Our dedicated staff and professional support services are also available to help you successfully meet, and exceed the unique needs of your clients.</p>

	<h3>HEALTHY COMPENSATION</h3>

	<p>Our compensation package is extremely competitive.  Think of us as the host agency that helps you go places, like to the bank. In fact, you can bank on these key benefits</p>

	<h3>HIGHEST COMMISSIONS</h3>

	<p>In fact, given our agency's immense booking volume ($606 million in 2016), our agents earn the highest commission percentage possible with most key travel suppliers—both Virtuoso and non-Virtuoso—which means even more money in your pocket.   Wait, hear that?  It sounds like "ka-ching!"</p>
